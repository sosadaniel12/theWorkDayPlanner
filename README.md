# theWorkDayPlanner
I will be building a work day planner using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, JQuery and and Moment.js. By building this application, I will have an understanding in using third-party Web API's. I will also be able to use this planner in my daily routine for work, to be able to schedule all the events throughout the day.
